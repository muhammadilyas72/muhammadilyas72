## **About**

Hi, I'm Ilyas! I am a Mathematics graduate at the Indonesian Education University. I have an interest in the field of data science, especially data engineering and data analysis. I have honed my interest by following independent study programs on data analysis at ZENIUS and data engineering at Data Academy.

During my studies, I honed my skills in the field of data engineering by learning how to create, test, and maintain database architecture. I also gained experience in learning ETL, ELT and using SQL for data engineering.

There are other activities that I do to hone my data analyst skills by learning to translate numerical data into a form that is easily understood by everyone in the company. The experience I have in data analysis includes the Exploratory Data Analytics (EDA) process and creating dashboards as a result of analysis using Looker Studio and Tableau.

During independent study activities I can work well in a team or independently. This is due to my enthusiasm for discovering new insights and enthusiasm for solving complex problems.

My CV is in [pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FeNsGWDBzY5tbt_Y0mhT_nXVl0J4I-F_/view?usp=sharing) format.
